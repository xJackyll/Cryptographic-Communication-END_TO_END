# Cryptographic-Communication-END_TO_END
This is a project that allows you to communicate with those who have the same script in the local network encrypting the messages with Diffie-Hellman.

Requirements:
- install cryptography

Tips:
- Disable the virtual network of your Vm's because it may cause problems

P.S this script provides a good level of security in terms of encryption, but does not take action for attacks such as MITM
